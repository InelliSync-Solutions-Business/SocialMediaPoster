CORE OBJECTIVE:
Create a compelling ${threadCount}-part thread on ${params.topic} for ${params.audience} in a ${threadStyle} style.

THREAD STRUCTURE:
1. Hook Tweet - Attention-grabbing opening that introduces the topic and promises value
2-${threadCount}. Body Tweets - Develop your points logically, with each tweet building on the previous one
${threadCount + 1}. Closing Tweet - Summarize key takeaways and include a call to action

PLATFORM-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
${params.platform === 'twitter' 
  ? `- Each tweet must be under 280 characters\n- Number each tweet (e.g., "1/", "2/", etc.)\n- Make each tweet able to stand alone while also flowing as part of the thread\n- Use line breaks strategically for readability`
  : params.platform === 'linkedin'
  ? `- Each post can be longer (up to 1,300 characters)\n- More professional and detailed content\n- Number each post clearly\n- Include industry-specific insights`
  : `- Adapt content to ${params.platform}'s format and audience expectations\n- Number each post in the thread\n- Maintain consistent voice throughout`}

THREAD STYLE GUIDANCE:
${threadStyle === 'educational' 
  ? '- Focus on teaching a concept, skill, or sharing knowledge\n- Break down complex ideas into digestible parts\n- Include examples, analogies, or data points\n- Anticipate and address common questions'
  : threadStyle === 'storytelling'
  ? '- Create a narrative arc across the thread\n- Build tension or interest with each tweet\n- Use vivid language and specific details\n- Create emotional connection with the audience'
  : '- Present information in a clear, numbered or bulleted format\n- Each point should be distinct yet related to the overall theme\n- Use parallel structure for consistency\n- Prioritize points from most to least important'}

CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
- Tone: ${params.tone || 'professional'} but conversational
- Include specific, actionable insights
- Avoid generic advice or obvious statements
- Maintain a cohesive flow between tweets
${params.includeHashtags ? '- Include 1-2 relevant hashtags in select tweets' : ''}
${params.includeEmojis ? '- Use emojis strategically to emphasize points' : ''}

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return the thread as numbered posts (1/, 2/, etc.), with each post separated by two line breaks. Ensure each post can stand alone while contributing to the overall thread narrative.`;
